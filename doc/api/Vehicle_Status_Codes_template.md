# Vehicle Status Codes
*  intended to cover scenarios where the user can remedy the problem.
*  issues that cannot be resolved are also caught here but may be left under a general error code - no need for separate codes for issues that cannot be resolved by the user.
*  these codes are evolving as requirements change.
